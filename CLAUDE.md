# CLAUDE

This project is an extension to the Zed editor (see documentation at https://zed.dev/docs/).

This extension integrates Shortcut's MCP (hosted at https://github.com/useshortcut/mcp-server-shortcut) with the Zed text editor, so that users of that editor can interact with their Shortcut workspace via the MCP.
